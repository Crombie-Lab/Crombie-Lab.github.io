The Crombie Lab works primarily with <i>Caenorhabditis elegans </i>, a small free-living nematode species that has been central to no less than six Noble prizes!

Research projects in the lab are focused on understanding how evolution has shaped the patterns of natural genetic diversity in the species and learning about the roles specific genetic variants play in influencing traits related to human health, such as enironmental toxicant susceptability.
