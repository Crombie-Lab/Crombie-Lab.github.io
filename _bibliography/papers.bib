  abstract = "Treatment of parasitic nematode infections in humans and
              livestock relies on a limited arsenal of anthelmintic drugs that
              have historically reduced parasite burdens. However, anthelmintic
              resistance (AR) is increasing, and little is known about the
              molecular and genetic causes of resistance for most drugs. The
              free-living roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans has proven to be a
              tractable model to understand AR, where studies have led to the
              identification of molecular targets of all major anthelmintic
              drug classes. Here, we used genetically diverse C. elegans
              strains to perform dose-response analyses across 26 anthelmintic
              drugs that represent the three major anthelmintic drug classes
              (benzimidazoles, macrocyclic lactones, and nicotinic
              acetylcholine receptor agonists) in addition to seven other
              anthelmintic classes. First, we found that C. elegans strains
              displayed similar anthelmintic responses within drug classes and
              significant variation across drug classes. Next, we compared the
              effective concentration estimates to induce a 10\% maximal
              response (EC10) and slope estimates of each dose-response curve
              of each strain to the laboratory reference strain, which enabled
              the identification of anthelmintics with population-wide
              differences to understand how genetics contribute to AR. Because
              genetically diverse strains displayed differential
              susceptibilities within and across anthelmintics, we show that C.
              elegans is a useful model for screening potential nematicides
              before applications to helminths. Third, we quantified the levels
              of anthelmintic response variation caused by genetic differences
              among individuals (heritability) to each drug and observed a
              significant correlation between exposure closest to the EC10 and
              the exposure that exhibited the most heritable responses. These
              results suggest drugs to prioritize in genome-wide association
              studies, which will enable the identification of AR genes.",

              and boasts robust genomic resources and high levels of genetic
              variation across the species. In this study, we performed
              dose-response analysis across 23 environmental toxicants using
              eight C. elegans strains representative of species-wide genetic
              diversity. We observed substantial variation in EC10 estimates
              and slope parameter estimates of dose-response curves of
              different strains, demonstrating that genetic background is a
              significant driver of differential toxicant susceptibility. We

              population-wide differences among strains are necessary to
              understand responses to toxicants. Moreover, we quantified the
              heritability of responses (phenotypic variance attributable to
              genetic differences between individuals) to each toxicant
              exposure and observed a correlation between the exposure closest
              to the species-agnostic EC10 estimate and the exposure that

              variance in susceptibility to at least one exposure level of each
              compound was explained by genetic differences among the eight C.
              elegans strains. Taken together, these results provide robust
              evidence that heritable genetic variation explains differential
              susceptibility across an array of environmental pollutants and

              include conjugates between 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP) and several
              amino acids (3HP-AAs), which are much higher in abundance in one
              of the wild strains. 3HP is an intermediate in the propionate
              shunt pathway, which is activated when flux through the
              canonical, vitamin-B12-dependent propionate breakdown pathway is

              substrate. Our results suggest that the production of 3HP-AAs
              represents a 'shunt-within-a-shunt' pathway to accommodate a

              step towards the development of metabolic network models that

              discrepancies between the properties of segregating genetic
              variants and of mutations accumulated experimentally under
              minimal selection, provided the mutational process is the same in

              differs between C. elegans laboratory mutation accumulation (MA)
              experiments and the standing site-frequency spectrum, which has
              been argued to be in part owing to increased oxidative stress in
              the laboratory environment. Using genome sequence data from C.
              elegans MA lines carrying a mutation (mev-1) that increases the
              cellular titer of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to
              increased oxidative stress, we find the base-substitution
              spectrum is similar between mev-1, its wild-type progenitor (N2),
              and another set of MA lines derived from a different wild strain
              (PB306). Conversely, the rate of short insertions is greater in
              mev-1, consistent with studies in other organisms in which
              environmental stress increased the rate of insertion-deletion
              mutations. Further, the mutational properties of mononucleotide
              repeats in all strains are different from those of
              nonmononucleotide sequence, both for indels and
              base-substitutions, and whereas the nonmononucleotide spectra are
              fairly similar between MA lines and wild isolates, the
              mononucleotide spectra are very different, with a greater
              frequency of A:T $\rightarrow$ T:A transversions and an increased
              proportion of $\pm$1-bp indels. The discrepancy in mutational
              spectra between laboratory MA experiments and natural variation
              is likely owing to a consistent (but unknown) effect of the
              laboratory environment that manifests itself via different modes

              fitness, when two or more entities (e.g., genotypes) are allowed
              to compete directly. In theory, competitive fitness is simple to
              measure: an experimental population is initiated with the
              different types in known proportions and allowed to evolve under
              experimental conditions to a predefined endpoint. In practice,
              there are several obstacles to obtaining robust estimates of
              competitive fitness in multicellular organisms, the most
              pervasive of which is simply the time it takes to count many
              individuals of different types from many replicate populations.
              Methods by which counting can be automated in high throughput are
              desirable, but for automated methods to be useful, the bias and
              technical variance associated with the method must be (a) known,
              and (b) sufficiently small relative to other sources of bias and
              variance to make the effort worthwhile. The nematode
              Caenorhabditis elegans is an important model organism, and the

              often of interest. We report a comparison of three experimental

              strains are competed against GFP-marked competitors under
              standard laboratory conditions. Population samples were split

              wild-type worms nor the among-sample variance differed
              significantly between the three methods. CellProfiler and the

              effects in an androdioecious organism. The rate of male-specific

              reduces organismal fitness, but relatively little is known about
              the mechanisms underlying this interaction. We investigated the
              role of molecular stress responses in driving this synergistic
              interaction using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans To induce
              oxidative stress, we used the pro-oxidant compounds acrylamide,
              paraquat and juglone. As expected, we found that heat stress and
              oxidative stress interact synergistically to reduce survival.
              Compared with exposure to each stressor alone, during
              simultaneous sublethal exposure to heat stress and oxidative
              stress the normal induction of key oxidative-stress response
              (OxSR) genes was generally inhibited, whereas the induction of
              key heat-shock response (HSR) genes was not. Genetically
              activating the SKN-1-dependent OxSR increased a marker for
              protein aggregation and decreased whole-worm survival during heat
              stress alone, with the latter being independent of HSF-1. In
              contrast, compared with wild-type worms, inactivating the HSR by
              HSF-1 knockdown, which would be expected to decrease basal heat
              shock protein expression, increased survival during oxidative
              stress alone. Taken together, these data suggest that, in C.

              the same extent that each can be activated during a single

              reduction in survival during combined exposure to heat stress and
              oxidative stress is due, at least in part, to inhibition of the
              OxSR during activation of the HSR.",

              outcrossing to selfing decreases the effective population size,
              effective recombination rate and heterozygosity within a species.
              These changes lead to a reduction in genetic diversity, and
              therefore adaptive potential, by intensifying the effects of
              random genetic drift and linked selection. Within the nematode
              genus Caenorhabditis, selfing has evolved at least three times,
              and all three species, including the model organism
              Caenorhabditis elegans, show substantially reduced genetic
              diversity relative to outcrossing species. Selfing and
              outcrossing Caenorhabditis species are often found in the same
              niches, but we still do not know how selfing species with limited
              genetic diversity can adapt to these environments. Here, we
              examine the whole-genome sequences from 609 wild C. elegans
              strains isolated worldwide and show that genetic variation is
              concentrated in punctuated hyper-divergent regions that cover
              20\% of the C. elegans reference genome. These regions are
              enriched in environmental response genes that mediate sensory
              perception, pathogen response and xenobiotic stress response.
              Population genomic evidence suggests that genetic diversity in
              these regions has been maintained by long-term balancing
              selection. Using long-read genome assemblies for 15 wild strains,
              we show that hyper-divergent haplotypes contain unique sets of

              reasons. First, when males are rare, selection on male-specific
              mutations is less efficient than in hermaphrodites. Second, males
              may present a larger mutational target than hermaphrodites
              because of the different ways in which fitness accrues in the two
              sexes. We report the first estimates of male-specific mutational
              effects in an androdioecious organism. The rate of male-specific
              inviable or sterile mutations is â©½5 $\times$ 10-4/generation,
              below the rate at which males would be lost solely due to those

              reduces organismal fitness, but relatively little is known about
              the mechanisms underlying this interaction. We investigated the
              role of molecular stress responses in driving this synergistic
              interaction using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans To induce
              oxidative stress, we used the pro-oxidant compounds acrylamide,
              paraquat and juglone. As expected, we found that heat stress and
              oxidative stress interact synergistically to reduce survival.
              Compared with exposure to each stressor alone, during
              simultaneous sublethal exposure to heat stress and oxidative
              stress the normal induction of key oxidative-stress response
              (OxSR) genes was generally inhibited, whereas the induction of
              key heat-shock response (HSR) genes was not. Genetically
              activating the SKN-1-dependent OxSR increased a marker for
              protein aggregation and decreased whole-worm survival during heat
              stress alone, with the latter being independent of HSF-1. In
              contrast, compared with wild-type worms, inactivating the HSR by
              HSF-1 knockdown, which would be expected to decrease basal heat
              shock protein expression, increased survival during oxidative
              stress alone. Taken together, these data suggest that, in C.

              the same extent that each can be activated during a single

              reduction in survival during combined exposure to heat stress and
              oxidative stress is due, at least in part, to inhibition of the
              OxSR during activation of the HSR.",

               bernacchii , Pagothenia borchgrevinki ) and non-Antarctic (
               Notothenia angustata , Bovichtus variegatus ) notothenioids were
               included in this study to investigate the mechanisms of cold
               adaptation of this pathway in polar species. Overall, there were
               significant differences in the levels of Ub-conjugated proteins
               between the Antarctic notothenioids and B. variegatus , with N.
               angustata possessing levels very similar to those of the
               Antarctic fishes. Proteasome activity in the gills of Antarctic
               fishes demonstrated a high degree of temperature compensation
               such that activity levels were similar to activities measured in
               their temperate relatives at ecologically relevant temperatures.
               A similar level of thermal compensation of proteasome activity
               was not present in the liver of two Antarctic fishes. Higher
               gill proteasome activity is likely due in part to higher
               cellular levels of proteins involved in the Ub--proteasome
               pathway, as evidenced by high mRNA expression of relevant genes.
               Reduced activity of the Ub--proteasome pathway does not appear
               to be the mechanism responsible for elevated levels of denatured
               proteins in Antarctic fishes, at least in the gills.",
